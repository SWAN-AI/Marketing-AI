## Introduction
In this project, we leverage multimodal data to predict the success of marketing campaigns. By analyzing textual content, images, and other relevant features, we aim to build a model that can accurately predict the performance of different marketing strategies.

## Data
The dataset used in this project consists of a combination of textual data, image data, and numerical features. The dataset is collected from various marketing campaigns and contains information such as campaign text, campaign images, target demographics, and campaign success metrics.

## Project Structure
The project has the following structure:


- `data/`: Directory containing the sample dataset files and images.
- `src/`: Directory containing the different models used in the project, such as text models, image models, and the multimodal model.
- `utils/`: Directory containing utility functions for data preprocessing and evaluation.
- `notebooks/`: Directory containing Jupyter notebooks for data analysis, text modeling, image processing, and multimodal modeling.
- `README.md`: This file you're currently reading.
- `requirements.txt`: File specifying the project dependencies.

## Setup
To set up the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

2. Install the required dependencies:

3. Download the necessary dataset files and place them in the `data/` directory.

## Usage
To run the project, you can use the provided Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks/` directory. Each notebook focuses on a specific aspect of the project, such as data analysis, text modeling, image processing, and multimodal modeling. Follow the instructions in the notebooks to execute the code and reproduce the results.

## Results
The project aims to achieve accurate predictions of marketing campaign success using multimodal data. The final model's performance is evaluated using appropriate metrics, and the results are presented in the notebooks or in a separate evaluation report.
